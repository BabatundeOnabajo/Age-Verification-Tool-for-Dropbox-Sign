# Age-Verification-Tool-for-Dropbox-Sign
This is an age verification tool for Dropbox Sign. It tries to gauge the age of a party to a contract yet to be signed. Where the party is deemed to be younger than the age of majority, the signature process facilitated by Dropbox Sign is aborted. The program uses image recognition to determine the age of a party to a contract.
